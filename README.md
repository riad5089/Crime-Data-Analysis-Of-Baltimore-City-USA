# Crime_Data_Analysis
## Project Description
The aim of this project is to analyze crime data to get insights, identify patterns, understand the characteristics of victims, and examine the relationship between crime with other features. This dataset reflects incidents of crime in the Baltimore City of Maryland of USA and the year of 2023.

Objectives:

1. Web Scraping and Data Collection: I have taken data from [this website](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/datasets/baltimore::part-1-crime-data/about) and dnd scraped 1000 data.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the scraped data to handle missing values and other preprocessing step.

Data Exploration and Visualization: Utilize Tableau to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create interactive visualizations. Generate charts, graphs, and maps to highlight crime patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset.

Geospatial Analysis: Incorporate geospatial data to visualize crime incidents on a map. Identify crime hotspots, high-risk areas, and spatial clusters to provide valuable insights for law enforcement and urban planning.

Temporal Analysis: Analyze crime patterns over time, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly trends. Identify seasonality or specific time periods associated with increased or decreased criminal activities.
