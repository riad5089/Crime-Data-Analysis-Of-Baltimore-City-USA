# Crime_Data_Analysis
## Project Description
The aim of this project is to analyze crime data to get insights, identify patterns, understand the characteristics of victims, and examine the relationship between crime with other features. This dataset reflects incidents of crime in the Baltimore City of Maryland of USA and the year of 2023.

Objectives:

1. Web Scraping and Data Collection: I have taken data from [this website](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/datasets/baltimore::part-1-crime-data/about) and dnd scraped 1000 data.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the scraped data to handle missing values and other preprocessing step.

3. Visualization: Utilize Tableau to create interactive visualizations. Generate pie charts, bar charts, maps and many more to highlight crime patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset. Here is my [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/md.abdur.sobhan.riad/viz/Crime_analysis_16873409234090/Dashboard1?publish=yes
